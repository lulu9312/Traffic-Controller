# Traffic-Controller
Traffic light controller is a basic microcontroller project based on 8051. I have used Keil IDE for writng the code.The simulation of the project was done in Proteus.
In this project I have used three led's which are Red, Green and yellow for indicating the signal.The yellow signal is on for 1 second whereas the green signal is on for 5 second. For generating the delay I haved used the internal Timer in 8051 which gives precise delay.
